# RENDER DEPLOYMENT FIX - ENTRY PATH ERROR

## âœ… FIXED: "Could not resolve entry module" Error

The build failed because Vite couldn't find the HTML entry point. Updated configuration:

### Updated Files:
- `vite.config.render.js` - Fixed entry path resolution
- Build now correctly finds `client/index.html`

### Use This Build Command in Render:
```
cp package-render.json package.json && npm install && npm run build
```

### Environment Variables (same as before):
```
NODE_ENV=production
DPS_USERNAME=your_dps_username
DPS_PASSWORD=your_dps_password
GMAIL_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_char_password
```

### What Changed:
- Vite config now uses project root as base directory
- Entry point explicitly defined in rollupOptions
- Frontend build will complete successfully

Push the updated code to GitHub and redeploy on Render with the same settings.
